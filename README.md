# RockPaperScissors
A Python Rock, Paper, Scissors game against a CPU. Completed as a College C.S Final Group Project

This is a simple Rock Paper Scissors game written in Python using the Tkinter library. The game allows the player to select one of three options (rock, paper, or scissors) and play against the computer. The game keeps track of the score and displays the result of each match.

To run the game, open the script in a Python interpreter and run the root.mainloop() function. The game window will open and you can start playing. Click on one of the three buttons to select your move and the game will display the result of the match. The game can be reset at any time by clicking the "Reset" button.

## Requirements
Note: The script requires the Tkinter library to be installed. To install Tkinter, run the following command in your terminal:

pip install tkinter
